        <p>Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them.
            This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not bound by a media query.
            The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.
